# Alticha-voucher_swap-Razmashat-RootKit-voucher_swap
This combines Alticha-voucher_swap + Razmashat-RootKit-voucher_swap to get a FileManager on A12

WARNING-- I did not modify the UI, and tried to keep the individual projects that I combined working as intended. 

Special thanks to everyone in the community pushing the jailbreak along!!

*Especially s/o to Alticha for getting the A12 working and Razmashat for the File Manager*
